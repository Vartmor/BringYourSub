# Privacy Policy

**BringYourSub** is a privacy-first browser extension. We take your privacy seriously.

## Data Collection

**We collect absolutely no data.**

- ❌ No analytics
- ❌ No tracking
- ❌ No cookies
- ❌ No personal information
- ❌ No usage statistics

## API Key Storage

Your OpenAI API key is:

- ✅ Stored **locally** in your browser's storage
- ✅ **Never sent** to any server except OpenAI's official API
- ✅ **Never logged** or recorded
- ✅ Encrypted by your browser's built-in security

## How It Works

1. **All processing happens locally** in your browser
2. **Direct API calls** are made only to:
   - `youtube.com` - to fetch video transcripts
   - `api.openai.com` - to translate subtitles (using YOUR key)
3. **No intermediary servers** - we don't operate any backend

## Third-Party Services

The extension communicates only with:

| Service | Purpose | Your Data Sent |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| YouTube | Fetch video transcript | Video ID only |
| OpenAI API | Translation & Whisper | Transcript text + YOUR API key |

## Open Source
